**What is the Banker's Algorithm?**

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for the safety of resource allocation to multiple processes in a computer system. It operates by maintaining a set of resources and tracking the maximum resources each process may need. The algorithm checks whether granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state, meaning that all processes can complete without entering a deadlock. If the system is in a safe state after the request, the resources are allocated; otherwise, the request is denied.

function bankersAlgorithm (processes, resources, allocated, maximum, available): need = maximum - allocated  // Calculate the need matrix

    // Initialize work and finish arrays
    work = available
    finish = [false] * processes
    safeSequence = []

    // Find a safe sequence
    while length(safeSequence) < processes:
        found = false
        for i in range(processes):
            if finish[i] == false and need[i] <= work:
                // Simulate resource allocation
                work = work + allocated[i]
                finish[i] = true
                safeSequence.append(i)
                found = true
                break
        
        if not found:
            return "System is not in a safe state"

    return "Safe state: Yes, Safe sequence: " + safeSequence

**To use the Banker's Algorithm simulation:**

1. Input the number of processes and resources.

2. Enter the allocated and maximum resource matrices.

3. Provide the available resources.

4. The simulation will display the need matrix and indicate whether the system is in a safe state, along with the safe sequence if applicable.

**Applications of the Banker's Algorithm**

The Banker's Algorithm is used in various fields to manage resource allocation and prevent deadlock. Key applications include:

1. Operating Systems: Ensures safe allocation of CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

2. Database Management Systems: Manages concurrent access to resources, preventing contention.

3. Embedded Systems: Allocates resources for real-time tasks, ensuring timing constraints are met.

4. Multi-threaded Applications: Controls resource requests in multi-threaded environments to prevent deadlock.

5. Network Resource Management: Manages bandwidth and resources to prevent congestion.

6. Distributed Systems: Allocates resources across multiple nodes to avoid deadlock.

**Highlights of code**

1. All matrices will regenerate according to input

2. Warnings for unfilled input fields

3. Warnings if Max < Allocated resources

4. Generation of safe sequence by FCFS, if exists
